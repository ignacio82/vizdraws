Description: Interactive visualization for Bayesian prior and posterior distributions. 
    This package facilitates an animated transition between prior and posterior distributions. 
    Additionally, it splits the distribution into bars based on the provided 'breaks,' displaying 
    the probability for each region. If no 'breaks' are provided, it defaults to zero.
